# horiseon-accessibility-restructure

## Description


The Horiseon accessibility restructure is a project that required refactorization within the html elements. I had to change the divs elements to semantic elements for better structuring of the page. I restructured this projectin an attempt to display that I have retained a basic understanding of the html/css concepts that were covered in this weeks class(11dec23-15dec23). The problems that were solved through my restruture are as follows:
- add alt tags to increase accessibility
- edit html elements
- consolidate css 
- add titl
- set up a readme

all of these contributions enable to webpage to function and appear more readable for the consumer.
I learned that attention to detail will play a key role in my success throughout my dev career.
